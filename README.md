# Online Store
## Description of the Project
This is a console-based online store written in Java. It lets users browse a list of products, add them to a shopping cart, and check out. Itâ€™s a mini shopping system that demonstrates working with arrays, hash maps, file I/O, user input, and some basic object-oriented design in Java.
