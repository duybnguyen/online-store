# Online Store
## Description of the Project
This is a console-based online store written in Java. It lets users browse a list of products, add them to a shopping cart, and check out. Itâ€™s a mini shopping system that demonstrates working with arrays, hash maps, file I/O, user input, and some basic object-oriented design in Java.

## Interesting Piece of Code
Originally, the cart was an ArrayList<Product>, which made tracking quantities awkward, I had to loop through the list to count duplicates. Switching to a HashMap<Product, Integer> simplified everything: the key is the product, and the value is its count.

Adding an item is now just: cart.put(product, cart.getOrDefault(product, 0) + 1);


Displaying items and calculating totals is also easier, since you can directly access both the product and its count without extra loops.
